# API Documentation

For the purposes of this documentation, it is assumed that your server is installed on a server named `your-server.com`.

## Authentication

All client requests (excluding those from clients / users logged into this application's web interface) to retrieve data from this application must include a valid API token generated via this application's web interface. This token must be supplied as a query string parameter named `token`.

For example, a valid client request would look like this:

`http://your-server.com/some/end-point?token=<TOKEN VALUE HERE>`

> `/some/end-point` is a placeholder for a valid end point in this API

> `<TOKEN VALUE HERE>` is a placeholder for an actual 
valid token already generated by the client prior to the request.

When creating a token via this application's web interface, there are two fields associated with each token that are important and must be carefully set by the user creating the token:

* **Maximum Api Requests per Day:** a non-negative integer value that represents how many API request a token can make within a 24hr window. The default value is `0`, which means that the token can make unlimited requests to the API at anytime.

* **Expiry Date:** The date the token becomes invalid and no longer usable for making API requests.

## API Response Format

All API responses are in **JSON** ([Javascript Object Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)) format. Every response has the following schema structure:

```
{
    "status_code": 200,
    "status_desc": "Ok",
    "data": [
        {
            "cpu_number": 0,
            "usage_percentage": 0,
            "vendor": "GenuineIntel",
            "model": "Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3570 CPU @ 3.40GHz",
            "speed_mhz": 3392.312
        },
        {
            "cpu_number": 1,
            "usage_percentage": 5.05,
            "vendor": "GenuineIntel",
            "model": "Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3570 CPU @ 3.40GHz",
            "speed_mhz": 3392.312
        }
    ],
    "time_generated": "2020-09-03T15:31:42-06:00"
}
```

> Please note that the response above is just an example. The fields in the response above are always present in all responses, but their values will differ for each request.

The `data` property always contains the requested data if the request was successful (i.e. has a `status_code` value of **200** and a `status_desc` value of **Ok**), otherwise, the property will contain an empty array and the relevant status code and description to let the client know why the requested data was not returned. The `time_generated` property just contains a timestamp (in [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format)of when the response was generated by the server (i.e. your instance of this web application).

Below are the status codes and descriptions that can be returned in response to client requests to this application:



| Status Code | Status Description | Long Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 200 | OK | Request succeeded and client has been sent the requested data. |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Access denied by the server, request requires a valid token. An expired token or no token was supplied. |
| 403 | Forbidden | Access denied by the server, request requires a valid token that has permission to access specified endpoint. A token that does not have permission to access specified endpoint was supplied. <br><br>AS OF THE INITIAL RELEASE OF THIS APPLICATION, GRANTING EACH TOKEN PERMISSION TO SPECIFIC ENDPOINTS HAS NOT YET BEEN IMPLEMENTED, EACH TOKEN THAT IS NOT EXPIRED, CURRENTLY HAS PERMISSION TO ACCESS ALL ENDPOINTS. |
| 404 | Not Found | The server can not find the requested endpoint. |
| 405 | Method Not Allowed | The request HTTP method is known by the server but has been disabled and cannot be used for the requested endpoint. |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting"). Maximum API Requests per Day exceeded for the specified token. |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request. |
